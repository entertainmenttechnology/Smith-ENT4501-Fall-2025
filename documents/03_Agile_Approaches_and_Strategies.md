# Agile Techniques for Effective Reporting and Feedback

This document expands on the basic Agile Sprint Instructions by introducing **techniques that make Agile Reports more collaborative, detailed, and actionable**. Students should use these approaches to strengthen their weekly reports and to provide meaningful feedback to classmates.

## 1. User Stories

As humans, we respond instinctively to stories.  This is useful, as our profession, by and large, is to communicate by story.  Agile projects often describe work in terms of **user stories**, which frame goals from the perspective of a user or stakeholder.  Much has already been written about this, so I defer repetition and refer you to some of these.

**Format:**

* *As a \[user type], I want \[feature] so that \[reason/value].*

**Example:**

* *As a performer, I want the puppet tracking system to respond smoothly so that I can control the character in real time.*

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

Each user story or sprint goal should include **acceptance criteria** that define when the work can be considered complete.

**Example Criteria:**

* The Unity prototype runs for 2 minutes without crashing.
* The sensor data triggers at least 3 distinct visual responses.
* The bibliography includes at least 5 new credible references this week.

Acceptance criteria give peers and the instructor something specific to respond to when reviewing progress.

## 3. Definition of Done (DoD)

A **Definition of Done** (DoD) clarifies what it means for a task or milestone to be finished.

**Example:**

* *DoD for prototype iteration:* Basic interaction works, visuals respond in real time, and at least one peer has tested the build.

This reduces confusion and helps the class give focused feedback.

## 4. Blockers as Help Requests

When reporting blockers, frame them as **requests for collaboration** rather than just obstacles.

**Example:**

* *Blocker: OSC messages in Unity are delayed.*
* *Request: Does anyone have experience with Unity OSC plugins or alternatives to reduce latency?*

This invites classmates to contribute solutions.

## 5. Retrospective Prompts

Agile teams often run retrospectives with simple prompts:

* **What went well?**
* **What didn’t go well?**
* **What can we improve?**

Students can integrate these into their Agile Reports to provide more reflection and invite richer feedback.

## 6. Peer Feedback Framework

When responding to classmates’ Agile Reports, use:

* **Acknowledge:** Identify one clear strength.
* **Suggest:** Offer one improvement or adjustment.
* **Ask:** Pose one clarifying question.

This ensures every peer comment adds value and encourages dialogue.

## 7. Example Agile Report (Extended)

**Name:** Jane Doe
**Repository Link:** [https://github.com/janedoe/ENT4501-Project](https://github.com/janedoe/ENT4501-Project)

**Agile Report #3 Summary:**

* **User Story:** As a performer, I want responsive shadow visuals so that the audience feels immersed.
* **Current State:** Repo structure complete; Unity prototype renders shadows and basic puppet input. Uploaded Iteration Plan with 3 milestones.
* **Goals:** Add Budget & Inventory to Iteration Plan; integrate OSC for smoother puppet control.
* **Acceptance Criteria:** Puppet responds within 200ms latency; Iteration Plan shows 3 future sprints.
* **Blockers/Help Request:** Unity OSC latency — looking for plugin recommendations.
* **Definition of Done:** By next week, have a working puppet demo controlled by OSC messages with <200ms delay.
* **Next Steps:** Research Unity OSC plugins, prepare 2 slides (title + visuals) for Jury #1.

**Peer Feedback Example:**

* Acknowledge: Repo is well-structured and easy to navigate.
* Suggest: Break down Jury #1 slides into smaller weekly tasks.
* Ask: Will the OSC control also support multiple puppets or just one?

## Summary

By using **User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, Definitions of Done, Retrospective prompts, and structured Peer Feedback**, students will make their Agile Reports more concrete and actionable. This strengthens collaboration, helps identify problems early, and prepares projects for successful presentations.
