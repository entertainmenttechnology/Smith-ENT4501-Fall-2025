# Agile Philosophy and SRDMPA Alignment

This document introduces the Agile philosophy and explains how it aligns with our iterative **SRDMPS** framework: Speculate → Research → Design → Make → Publish → Assess.

## Agile Philosophy

Agile is a philosophy of **iterative, adaptive project development**. It grew out of software practices but applies widely to creative, technical, and research projects. Agile emphasizes:

- **Individuals and interactions** over rigid processes and tools.  
- **Working results** over excessive documentation.  
- **Collaboration** over strict negotiation.  
- **Responding to change** over following a fixed plan.  

In Agile, an **iteration** is often called a **sprint**: a short, focused burst of work (usually 1–3 weeks).

- [The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)  


## Why “Sprints”?

Instead of trying to map out everything from start to finish, Agile breaks work into **short cycles (sprints)**. Each sprint delivers some progress, however small, and then is assessed. That assessment drives the next sprint. This ensures that projects evolve responsively to discoveries, obstacles, and new opportunities.

- The term emphasizes intensity and focus: the team commits to specific goals within the timebox.  
- Unlike a marathon (a long, unchanging path), Sprints allow **continuous resets** and **adaptive course correction**.  


## Our SRDMPS Cycle

In this class, we use the **SRDMPA** framework:

1. **Speculate** – Ideation, vision, and planning.  
2. **Research** – Gathering knowledge, precedent studies, and feasibility trials.  
3. **Design** – Drafting documentation, mediation pathways, mockups, and prototypes.  
4. **Make / Produce** – Building, coding, fabricating, and testing.  
5. **Publish / Present** – Sharing work-in-progress or completed deliverables.  
6. **Assess** – Reflecting on outcomes, identifying bottlenecks, and guiding the next cycle.  

This cycle repeats at multiple levels:
- **Micro (weekly Sprints)**: A short loop of progress, reflection, and adjustment.  
- **Macro (semester)**: The full arc from speculative vision through research, design, production, publishing, and final assessment.

**In fact**, any component of SRDMPA can itself be expanded into a complete SRDMPA cycle itself, and often a single deliverable exists at different places if integrated with multiple projects.

## Agile ↔ SRDMPS Alignment

Although Agile practices map directly onto SRDMPS stages, note that in Agile some areas overlap or are subdivided differently. For example, a **Sprint Review** collects external feedback as part of its presentation, but also overlaps with assessment, while a **Retrospective** is a distinct internal reflection. Likewise, **Design/Refinement** indicates that design is not a one-time step but continues to evolve within and across sprints.



| Agile Practice         | SRDMPS Stage             | Explanation of Agile Component |
|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Sprint Planning        | Speculate                | The team sets goals and identifies tasks for the iteration. |
| Backlog Grooming       | Research                 | The team refines, researches, and prioritizes items needed for progress. |
| Design / Refinement    | Design                   | Drafting or refining design solutions before or during the sprint. |
| Implementation         | Make / Produce           | The hands-on building, coding, or producing of deliverables. |
| Sprint Review / Demo   | Publish / Present        | Sharing completed work for feedback from peers or stakeholders. |
| Retrospective          | Assess                   | Reflecting on successes, bottlenecks, and adjustments for the next sprint. |


## Key Idea

Agile and SRDMPS are both **cyclical and adaptive**:
- Every Sprint is a **bridge**: it closes with Assessment of what was done, and opens with Speculation for what comes next.  
- Documentation is not just a product — it is part of the process, feeding into the next cycle.  
- This recursive rhythm ensures that each project evolves deliberately, informed by real results rather than assumptions.  

**In short:** Agile gives us the *philosophy* of iteration and adaptation. SRDMPS gives us the *structure* to practice it in creative, technical, and research projects.

## What Differentiates Agile from SRDMPS?

While Agile and SRDMPS are aligned, they are **not identical**:

- **Agile is a philosophy** – a mindset for working iteratively, adaptively, and collaboratively. It is lightweight and principle-driven, leaving the exact stages flexible.  
- **SRDMPS is a structured framework** – it spells out six explicit stages (Speculate, Research, Design, Make, Publish, Assess) that provide scaffolding for students to follow.  
- Agile Sprints can be as simple as “Plan → Do → Reflect.” SRDMPS expands this into detailed categories that fit the **academic and creative context** of our program.  
- Agile often focuses on product delivery; SRDMPS balances **creative ideation, research, and reflection** as equally important outcomes.  

**In summary:** Agile tells us *how to think and adapt*; SRDMPS tells us *what stages to document and practice*. Together they give us both freedom and structure.

## What About [Scrum](https://scrumguides.org/)?

- **Scrum is a specific Agile framework**, not the same as Agile itself. It prescribes fixed roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team), ceremonies (Daily Standups, Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, Retrospective), and artifacts (Backlog, Burndown Charts).  
- In industry, Scrum is common, but it can be rigid for experimental or academic work.  
- **Our approach borrows from Agile, not strict Scrum**:  
  - We use *Sprints* for timeboxing and iteration.  
  - We emphasize assessment (similar to retrospectives).  
  - But we do **not** assign Scrum roles, require daily standups, or track velocity/burndown charts.  
- This keeps the focus on **learning, creativity, and adaptation** rather than enforcing a full industry-style process.  

**In short:** Scrum is one way to practice Agile. We use Agile principles aligned with SRDMPS, but adapt them to our educational and creative context rather than adopting full Scrum.
