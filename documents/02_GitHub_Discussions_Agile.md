# ENT 4501 – How to Use GitHub Discussions for Agile Feedback

This document explains how we will use GitHub Discussions in this class.  
It is very important that you follow these steps carefully each week so your Agile Reports and peer feedback are captured properly.

---

## Purpose
- Create a **central place** for student project reports and feedback.  
- Use GitHub’s **threaded discussion format** to organize responses by project.  
- Ensure that both **oral feedback in class** and **written follow-up comments** are documented.  
- Practice industry-style workflows where **work (repos)** and **feedback (discussions)** are linked but separate.

---

## Step 1 – Instructor creates the “Master” Discussion
- Each week, the instructor will open **one central discussion thread**.  
- Title will look like:  
  - `Week 2 Student Agile Reports – Post Your Project Here`  
- Inside the post you will see the rules and expectations.  

---

## Step 2 – Students create their own project thread
- **Each student creates ONE top-level comment** inside the master discussion.  
- Your comment must include:  
  - **Your name**  
  - **Repo link** (GitHub preferred; OpenLab or other approved system accepted)  
  - **GitHub ID** (if not already given)  
  - **Summary of your Agile Report** (Current State, Goals, Blockers, Next Steps)  
  - Optional: link to the full Agile Report in your repo  

This top-level comment = **your project’s thread** for that week.  

---

## Step 3 – Classmates give feedback
- Other students reply directly under your top-level comment.  
- Feedback should include:  
  - Suggestions for solving blockers  
  - Questions or clarifications  
  - Constructive critique  
- All replies will be **nested under your project comment** so the conversation is organized.  

---

## Step 4 – Capturing oral feedback
- During class, peers will give oral responses.  
- A **scribe** (assigned each week) will add a **summary of oral feedback** as a comment under your thread.  
- Peers who spoke in class must add **one written comment** after class (within 24 hours).  

---

## Step 5 – Weekly rhythm
1. Instructor creates the week’s master discussion.  
2. Students post their project threads (top-level comments).  
3. Class feedback is added in discussion replies.  
4. Students update their repos with their full Agile Report.  
5. Next week → repeat the cycle with a new master discussion.  

---

## Tips for Success
- **@mention classmates** when giving feedback so they get a notification.  
- Keep comments **clear and constructive**.  
- Respect time: aim for concise but useful responses.  
- Remember:  
  - **Your Repo = Your Work**  
  - **This Discussion Board = Our Feedback**
