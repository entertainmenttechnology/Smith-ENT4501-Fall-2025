# Instructions for Completing the Agile Sprint Log

The Agile Sprint Log is your **journal** of project development.  
Each log captures what you set out to do, what you accomplished, what problems arose, and how those lessons will shape the next Sprint.  

This is not just paperwork: it creates a **living record** of your project’s evolution. By the end of the semester, your journal will show a clear trail of ideas, experiments, failures, corrections, and successes — the story of your project.

## CORE vs. OPTIONAL Sections

Each Sprint Log is divided into sections. Not every Sprint will require all sections:

- **CORE sections** (always required):  
  1. Review of Previous Sprint  
  2. Speculate / Plan  
  3. Assess  

- **OPTIONAL sections** (fill only if you worked in that area during the Sprint):  
  - Research  
  - Design  
  - Make / Produce  
  - Publish / Present  

This keeps the form light while ensuring you still document meaningful progress.

## Header Information

At the top of every Sprint Log, fill in:  
- **Project Title**: The name of your project.  
- **Sprint #**: Number your Sprints sequentially (Sprint 1, Sprint 2, etc.).  
- **Date Range**: The start and end dates for this Sprint.  
- **Prepared by**: Your name (or team name, if collaborative).  

*Example:*  
- Project Title: *Interactive Shadow Puppet Performance*  
- Sprint #: 3  
- Date Range: Sept 22–Sept 29  
- Prepared by: Jane Doe

## Section Details

### 0. Review of Previous Sprint (CORE)
**Purpose:** Reflect honestly on how the last Sprint went.  
**Include:**  
- The goal you set previously.  
- Whether it was achieved.  
- Problems or bottlenecks that appeared.  
- Feedback received.  
- Any tasks you are carrying forward.  

### 1. Speculate / Plan (CORE)
**Purpose:** Define what this Sprint will focus on, guided by your last Assessment.  
**Include:**  
- A clear Sprint Goal.  
- A short checklist of tasks.  
- Planned Deliverables (prototype, diagram, report, etc.).  
- **Research Needed**: knowledge gaps you must investigate.  

### 2. Research (OPTIONAL)
**Purpose:** Capture what you investigated.  
**Include:**  
- Questions identified in Speculate.  
- Sources consulted (articles, Zotero, tutorials, AI, etc.).  
- Key insights.  

### 3. Design (OPTIONAL)
**Purpose:** Record conceptual or technical design work.  
**Include:**  
- New diagrams, mockups, or mediation pathways.  
- Key decisions and rationale.  
- Criteria for success.  

### 4. Make / Produce (OPTIONAL)
**Purpose:** Track building, coding, or prototyping.  
**Include:**  
- What you built or tested.  
- Tools/technologies used.  
- Evidence: screenshots, commits, or photos.  

### 5. Publish / Present (OPTIONAL)
**Purpose:** Document how you shared your work.  
**Include:**  
- Updates pushed to GitHub.  
- Presentations, demos, or slides.  

### 6. Assess (CORE)
**Purpose:** Close the loop. Assessment drives the next Sprint.  
**Include:**  
- Successes this Sprint.  
- Problems or bottlenecks (skills, tools, time, clarity).  
- Feedback received.  
- Adjustments for the next Sprint.  

### 7. Reflection (Optional but Encouraged)
**Purpose:** Capture broader learning.  
**Include:**  
- Personal/team insights.  
- AI use: what you tried, how you validated outputs.

## Journalling Requirement

Each Sprint Log is one entry in your project journal.  
Your journal should:

- Be stored in a `/journal` folder in your GitHub repo.  
- Contain Sprint Logs as individual files: `sprint-01.md`, `sprint-02.md`, etc.  
- Include a `journal-index.md` file linking all Sprint Logs.  
- After each log, store **linked documentation**: research notes, diagrams, code, test logs, slides, etc.  
- Always include **citations** for research sources (Zotero citekeys, DOIs, URLs).  
- Record **discarded experiments and ideas** with a note on why they were abandoned.  

---

## Key Point
Each Sprint Log is a **bridge**: it closes the last Sprint with assessment and opens the next Sprint with speculation and planning.  
This continuity ensures your project evolves deliberately, with each step informed by the last.
