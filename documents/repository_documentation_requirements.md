# Repository Documentation Requirements – ENT 4501 Culmination Project

Each student must maintain a **public-facing repository** to organize their project materials and documentation. Students may use the platform of their choice (GitHub is strongly recommended, but OpenLab or other approved systems are acceptable). The **materials are required**, but the structure and exact formatting may vary by platform.

---

## Required Elements (Checklist)
1. **Overview & Orientation (README or equivalent)**  
2. **Agile Reports** (weekly, using Extended Agile Template)  
3. **Iteration Plan & Timeline** (milestones, sprints, and schedule)  
4. **Bibliography / References**  
5. **Budget & Inventory**  
6. **Project Materials** (code, assets, prototypes, fabrication files)  
7. **Final Documentation** (Owner’s Manual, Lessons Learned, Presentation Materials)  

---

## 1. Overview & Orientation
- **README (or equivalent top-level document)**
  - Project title and short description.
  - Navigation guide to key folders/files.
  - Contact information (name, email, GitHub ID or platform ID).

---

## 2. Agile Reports
- Weekly reports using the **Extended Agile Sprint Report Template**.
- Should be clearly labeled and easy to navigate.
- Each report includes:
  - Retrospective (from last week)
  - Current State
  - User Story (Next Sprint Focus)
  - Acceptance Criteria (Given–When–Then)
  - Definition of Done (DoD)
  - Goals (Steps toward the DoD)
  - Blockers (as Help Requests)
  - Next Steps

---

## 3. Iteration Plan & Timeline
- A **living document** that tracks milestones and sprints.
- Must include a **timeline** that shows:
  - Key development phases leading to Jury #1, Jury #2, and Final Presentation.
  - Major project deliverables (prototype checkpoints, research updates, documentation drafts).
- Should be updated regularly to reflect progress and adjustments.

---

## 4. Bibliography / References
- A record of all sources that inform the project:
  - Technical precedents
  - Inspirations
  - Academic or industry references
- Can be managed through Zotero or included as a Markdown/Word file.

---

## 5. Budget & Inventory
- A working document that lists:
  - Projected costs (software, hardware, materials)
  - Inventory of tools and resources used
- Updated regularly to reflect actual expenditures.

---

## 6. Project Materials
- Code, assets, prototypes, and fabrication files.
- Organized in clear subfolders (e.g., `/Code`, `/DesignAssets`, `/Fabrication`) if the platform allows.
- Large binary files (e.g., video, 3D models) may be linked externally if needed.

---

## 7. Final Documentation
At the end of the semester, the repository must include:
- **Owner’s Manual**
  - Documentation for both the **system** (engineering, technical setup) and the **content** (design, creative work).
  - Instructions for how the project can be operated or replicated.
- **Lessons Learned**
  - A reflective section describing successes, challenges, and insights gained.
- **Presentation Materials**
  - Slides, poster-equivalent, or demo links used in Jury presentations.

---

## 8. Continuous Maintenance
- Documentation should be updated **weekly**, not left until the end.
- Best practice: update Agile Reports, Iteration Plan, and Budget immediately after each sprint cycle.
- The goal is that documentation becomes **organization, not rewriting** at the end of the semester.

---

**Reminder:** Students may choose the repository platform they prefer, but **all required elements above must be included and clearly organized.**
