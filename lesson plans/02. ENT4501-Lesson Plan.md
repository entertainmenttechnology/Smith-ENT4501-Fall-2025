**Duration:** 1 hour 40 minutes (100 minutes)  
**Date/Time:** Tuesday, Sept 2, 2025  
**Focus:** Student Reports on Week 1 Homework Assignment + Agile Feedback Cycle  
**Students:** 9  

---

## Learning Objectives
- Present Week 1 Homework Assignment as a structured Agile Report.  
- Recognize how reports map onto the SRDMPA cycle.  
- Engage in peer brainstorming, both orally and in written GitHub Discussions.  
- Provide GitHub IDs and repository links for continuous documentation.  
- Begin considering how to **catalog and assess feedback** for long-term use.

## Session Breakdown

### 1. Welcome & Setup (10 min)
- Roll call + Zoom check.  
- Confirm each student has a **public repository** or requests a GitHub shell.  
- Reiterate course focus: **MAKE / PRODUCE → PUBLISH / PRESENT → ASSESS**.  
- Explain today’s goal: live Agile Report cycle + class feedback captured in Discussions.  

### 2. Framing Agile (10 min)
- Show Agile cycle slide (Plan → Build → Review → Reflect → Next Sprint).  
- Explain how Week 1 Homework already matches Agile format:  
  - Current State  
  - Goals  
  - Blockers  
  - Next Steps  
- Clarify: Oral feedback in class must be summarized and added to GitHub Discussions, with follow-up written comments within 24 hours.  
- Mention: Later in the semester we will explore how to **catalog and assess feedback** in a more structured way (Master Boards).  

### 3. Student Reports + Feedback (70 min total)
**Format per student (~8 min):**  
1. **Report (4–5 min)** – Summary of Week 1 Homework (state, keep/change, milestone, blockers).  
2. **Class Brainstorm (2–3 min)** – Peers respond orally, scribe records summary in the student’s Discussion thread.  
3. **Repo/ID Check (30 sec)** – Student provides GitHub ID + repo link.  

Nine students × ~8 min = ~70 min.  

During reports:
- Instructor reminds peers: all oral ideas must also appear in the **Discussion thread**.  
- Presenting student can begin thinking about how they will eventually catalog and evaluate this feedback.  

### 4. Reflection & Agile Reinforcement (5 min)
- Highlight patterns across student reports.  
- Emphasize Agile Report cycle: **Current State → Goals → Blockers → Next Steps**.  
- Raise a question for students: *How might you track feedback across the semester so it remains useful?* (Introduce the idea of feedback cataloging for future discussion.)  

### 5. Closing & Assignments (5 min)
**Assignments for Week 3:**  
1. Post **Agile Report #2** in repo.  
2. Update **iteration plan** with milestones.  
3. Contribute at least **one written comment** in peers’ Discussion threads.  
4. Ensure **public repo link/GitHub ID** is finalized.
