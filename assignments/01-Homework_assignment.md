**Due:** Week 2 (Remote, Tuesday Sept 2)  
**Submit:** Public repository link + Agile Report #1 + Iteration Plan  


## Part 1 â€“ Establish Repository

- Acceptable platforms: GitHub (recommended), OpenLab, or another approved system.  
- Your repo must include:  
  - A folder for weekly **Agile Reports**.  
  - A section for **documentation and iteration plans**.  

## Part 2 â€“ Agile Report #1 (Baseline)
This is your first Agile report, documenting the **state of the project as of Week 1**.  
Create a markdown file (or equivalent) in your repo using this template:  
[01_Agile_Sprint_Entry.md](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-ENT4501-Fall-2025/blob/main/documents/01_Agile_Sprint_Entry.md)

Review of Previous sprint
- **Current State**: What you have now (prototype, documentation, assets).

- **Blockers**: Problems, concerns, or open questions you need feedback on.  
- **Next Steps**: What you will build, test, or refine before Week 2.  



## Part 3 â€“ Iteration Plan (Sprint Roadmap)
Using the course syllabus as a guide, sketch out your **major sprints**:  

- **Sprint 1 â†’ Weeks 1â€“3**: Early iterations, first builds, repo setup.  
- **Sprint 2 â†’ Weeks 4â€“7**: Integrated components, documentation framework.  
- **Sprint 3 â†’ Weeks 8â€“9**: Mid-semester presentation, feedback integration.  
- **Sprint 4 â†’ Weeks 10â€“13**: Refinement, ownerâ€™s manual, poster session prep.  
- **Sprint 5 â†’ Weeks 14â€“15**: Final juried presentation, repo freeze, Lessons Learned.  

Each sprint should identify:  
- Target prototype progress.  
- Documentation goals (ownerâ€™s manual sections, repo updates).  
- Presentation or review milestones.  

Post this as a short document in your repository.

## Deliverables for Week 2
1. **Repository link** (public, shared with instructor).  
2. **Agile Report #1** (baseline state + Week 2 sprint goals).  
3. **Iteration Plan (Sprint Roadmap)** aligned with syllabus checkpoints.

ðŸ“Œ **Reminder:** Each week you will submit an Agile Report in your repository, following the same structure:  
**Current State â†’ Goals â†’ Blockers â†’ Next Steps.**  
These reports will form the backbone of your documentation and will feed directly into your midterm, poster session, and final presentations.
