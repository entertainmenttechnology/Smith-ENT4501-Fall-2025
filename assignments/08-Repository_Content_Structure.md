# Assignment 8 – Repository Audit & Presentation Planning

## 🎯 Purpose & Rationale
This assignment serves as both a **repository audit** and a **presentation planning checkpoint** for your Culmination Project.  
Your repository is not just a collection of files—it is the **official record** of your creative and technical process. A complete, well-structured repository allows adjudicators, faculty, and peers to **understand and evaluate your work** quickly and accurately.  

Beyond the classroom, your repository represents your project to **external reviewers, potential collaborators, and future employers**. Outside adjudicators will use these materials as part of the **final summative assessment**, evaluating your professionalism, clarity, and creative rigor.  

This repository also acts as a **public-facing archive and integration hub**, supporting any future development or partnerships that may build on your work.  Learning to maintain this structure now prepares you for collaboration in academic, professional, and interdisciplinary contexts.

By completing this assignment, you will:
- Ensure your documentation is **complete, functional, and accessible**.
- Identify areas that need additional work in order to complete the required materials.   
- Demonstrate professional-level project management and version control.  
- Prepare your **presentation materials** for upcoming public review.  
- Receive **peer and instructor feedback** to strengthen your documentation and final deliverables.

## 🔍 Overview
Each student will conduct a full audit of their project documentation and repository structure. You will verify that all materials required for the **Final Presentation** are present, clearly labeled, and properly linked.  
You will also outline what materials you intend to prepare for your **next presentation session** (poster, kiosk, demo, video, etc.).

All materials referenced in this assignment must also be contained in your main project repository—hosted on GitHub, OpenLab, or another approved platform.

## 🔧 Deliverables
Submit your work as a document or post it in your repository under the folder `/assignments/Week8_Repository_Audit`.  
This report should include the following sections:

### 1. Repository Link & Access Verification
- Provide a **direct working link** to your main project repository or documentation hub.  
- Confirm that permissions are properly set for adjudicator access.
- If your materials are distributed (e.g., GitHub + Google Drive + OpenLab + Zotero), provide navigation instructions or separate links However your main document landing page MUST contian easy access to all components.

### 2. Project Overview
Provide a short written summary:
- **Project Title**  
- **High-Level Description (2–4 sentences):** What is your project? Why does it matter? Who is it for?  

Then, include a **table** of all required documentation elements with both a link and a completion status.  
Use one of the following indicators for status:  
✅ Complete  	⚙️ In Progress  	🚧 Not Started  	❓ Needs Review  

**Example Table:**
Required / advantageous components are listed below: make sure you have plans to complete each of these.  

| Component | Link | Status |
|------------|------|--------|
| Repository Home | [URL] | ✅ Complete |
| Presentation Slides / Demo Video | [URL] | ⚙️ In Progress |
| Proof of Concept (MTEC 3501) | [URL] | ✅ Complete |
| Current Semester Version (LVP) | [URL] | ⚙️ In Progress |
| Climax Version Documentation | [URL] | 🚧 Not Started |
| Iteration Plan & Timeline | [URL] | ✅ Complete |
| Weekly Agile Reports | [URL] | ⚙️ In Progress |
| Bibliography / References | [URL] | ✅ Complete |
| Budget & Inventory | [URL] | ⚙️ In Progress |
| Project Materials (Code / Assets / Fabrication) | [URL] | ✅ Complete |
| Final Documentation (Owner’s Manual or Process Notes) | [URL] | 🚧 Not Started |
| Mid Semester / Final Presentations (Power Point, Google Slides, pdf, etc) | [URL] |  ✅ Complete |
| Lessons Learned | [URL] | ⚙️ In Progress |

> You may adjust or expand this list as appropriate for your project type, but all major components must be present and properly linked.

### 3. Presentation Planning
Describe your plan for your **next presentation session** (Jury or Open Showcase).  

- **ENT students** are required to have a **poster** prepared for their presentation.  
- **MTEC students** may choose alternate formats such as **interactive demos, videos, kiosk-style displays, or projection-based presentations**.  

Your plan should specify:
- The **format** you intend to use.  
- The **content** that will be presented (slides, prototypes, demos, videos, etc.).  
- Any **equipment or software requirements** for your presentation setup.  
- A note on how your **documentation materials** (poster, slides, QR codes, or digital links) will accompany the live presentation.

### 4. Reflection
Write a short reflection (4–6 sentences):
- What did you learn from conducting this audit?  
- Which areas of your documentation are strongest?  
- What still needs attention before your final presentation?  

### 5. Blockers or Help Requests
Identify any current challenges or questions where you would like instructor or peer feedback.


## 🔹 Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated on:
- **Completeness and accuracy** of links and documentation.  
- **Clarity** of your project overview and presentation plan.  
- **Professional organization** of materials and readiness for adjudication.  
- **Self-assessment honesty** and reflection on progress.  
- **Responsiveness to prior feedback** (showing improvement since Presentation 1).  


## 🗓️ Deadlines
