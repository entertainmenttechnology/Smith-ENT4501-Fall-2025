# Week 1 Writing Prompt: Where We Stand, Where We Go

## Context for Students
Today we start by stopping.  Step back from the table, and take a close look at the current state of your project — think about your project as it exists right now,  where you want to take it, things that have changed in the summer, and in poarticular, identify challenges or areas of concern that you may wish to bring up. Write down your thoughts. We’ll come back later and talk about how this fits into the larger process.

This is an initial SPECULATION, that should serve as a bridge between last semester and this semester.

## Prompt (to be written in your repository log or notebook, 15 minutes)
1. **Where We Stand:** Describe your project’s current state. What do you have in hand? (prototype, documentation, assets, ideas, etc.)  
2. **What to Keep:** Name one thing from your current project that is strong and you plan to carry forward.  
3. **What to Change:** Name one thing you want to alter, fix, or improve this semester.
4. **Challenges and Problems:** What areas of your project are currently causing you concern?   
5. **What’s Next:** Identify the first concrete step you’ll take to move your project forward this term.

## Deliverable
- A **Week 1 log entry** in your repository (or equivalent system).  
- Be ready to share your project, and your speculations aloud in discussion.

## Follow-up (after discussion)
Once you’ve written and shared, we will return to this reflection and show how it connects to the larger project development framework. By starting from a blank slate, you’ve already begun the new phase without needing labels.
