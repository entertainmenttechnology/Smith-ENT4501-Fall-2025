# Week 1 Writing Prompt: Where We Stand, Where We Go

## Context for Students
Today we reset the table. Forget the labels for a moment — just think about your project as it exists right now, and where you want to take it. Write down your thoughts. We’ll come back later and talk about how this fits into the larger process.

## Prompt (to be written in your repository log or notebook, 15 minutes)
1. **Where We Stand:** Describe your project’s current state. What do you have in hand? (prototype, documentation, assets, ideas, etc.)  
2. **What to Keep:** Name one thing from your current project that is strong and you plan to carry forward.  
3. **What to Change:** Name one thing you want to alter, fix, or improve this semester.  
4. **What’s Next:** Identify the first concrete step you’ll take to move your project forward this term.  

---

## Deliverable
- A **Week 1 log entry** in your repository (or equivalent system).  
- Be ready to share one highlight (success, change, or next step) aloud in discussion.

## Follow-up (after discussion)
Once you’ve written and shared, we will return to this reflection and show how it connects to the larger project development framework. By starting from a blank slate, you’ve already begun the new phase without needing labels.
