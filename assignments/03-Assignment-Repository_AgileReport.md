# Week 3 Assignment – Iteration Planning, Repository Setup, and Research Bibliography

**Due:** Week 4 class meeting  
**Modality:** Asynchronous  

This week we continue our Agile development process, but now start to focus on designing and assembling your first presentation.  In week 5/6 you will be doing an oral presentation to our jury, and it is in your best interest to create a compelling one. Your assignment for this week then, along with the continuation of project development, is to create or add to your public repository, ensure you have at least rudimentary materials in each area, and to develop a milestone timeline that shows your semester plans for completion.  You will also within the Discussion Board continue your feedback and ideas for other students projects.  


## Objectives
- Establish and share a **public repository** for your project.  
- Document your **Agile Report #3**.  
- Create an **Iteration Plan/Timeline** leading to your Week 5/6 jury presentation.  
- Begin compiling a **bibliography** of inspirations, precedents, and technical resources.  
- Provide and receive peer feedback through Discussions.  



## Part 1 – Public Repository (Required)
- By this week, each student must maintain a **public-facing project repository**.  
- **GitHub is strongly recommended**, but OpenLab or another approved platform is acceptable if it can:  
  - Host weekly Agile Reports,  
  - Include an Iteration Plan/Timeline,  
  - Provide stable public links for instructor and peers,  
  - Support continuous updating throughout the semester.  

### Repository Expectations
- Your repository must include a **top-level overview document** that serves as the entry point to your project.  
  - On GitHub: typically `README.md`.  
  - On OpenLab, Google Drive, or other platforms: a clearly labeled document (Word, PDF, or page) that serves the same function.  
- This overview must include:  
  - **Project overview** (title, purpose, goals).  
  - **Navigation guide** (where to find Agile Reports, Iteration Plan, Bibliography, and Project Materials).  
  - **Links** to key files or subfolders.  
- Recommended folder structure (adapt to your platform):  
  - `/AgileReports` (weekly reports)  
  - `/IterationPlan` (milestones & timeline)  
  - `/Bibliography` (Zotero link or export, plus notes)  
  - `/ProjectMaterials` (assets, code, sketches, prototypes)  

**Deliverable:** Post your public repository link in the Week 3 Master Discussion.

## Part 2 – Agile Report #3
- Add your Week 3 Agile Report to the repository.  
- Format:  
  - **Current State** – What progress have you made since Week 2?  
  - **Goals** – Sprint goals for this week.  
  - **Blockers** – Problems or concerns you’re encountering.  
  - **Next Steps** – Concrete tasks before Week 4.  

---

## Part 3 – Iteration Plan & Timeline
- Create or update an **Iteration Plan file** in your repository.  
- This plan must:  
  - Break the project into **sprints** leading to the Week 5/6 jury presentation.  
  - Identify **deliverables per sprint** (prototype progress + documentation goals).  
  - Include a marker showing **what you will present in Week 5/6** (even if rough).  
  - Add a **Budget & Inventory** section listing resources, materials, and costs (or $0 if already covered).  
- A visual chart, table, or diagram is encouraged.  

---

## Part 4 – Research Bibliography
- Begin a **bibliography** of inspirations, background research, and technical precedents.  
- Use **Zotero** (preferred) or another bibliography tool.  
- Bibliography should include:  
  - **Inspirations** (artists, projects, performances, designs).  
  - **Precedents** (previous works in your area of practice).  
  - **Technical resources** (articles, software/hardware documentation, tutorials).  
- **Deliverable:** Upload a bibliography file (BibTeX, RIS, or Markdown export) or provide a Zotero group link in your repository.  

---

## Part 5 – Peer Feedback
- In the **Week 3 Master Discussion**, post:  
  - Repo link  
  - Agile Report summary (Current State → Goals → Blockers → Next Steps)  
  - Link to your Iteration Plan  
  - Link to your bibliography or Zotero library  
- Review at least **2 classmates’ posts** and provide constructive written feedback:  
  - Acknowledge strengths.  
  - Suggest improvements for sprint planning, repo structure, or bibliography.  
  - Ask clarifying questions.
